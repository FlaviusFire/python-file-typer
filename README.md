# python-file-typer
Copy contents of a file in clip-board limited scenarios via keyboard input

Known issues:
Indendation is currently inconsistantly functional. Assume it won't properly dublicate indentation or "tabs".
Sometimes typing will appear to freeze, which I imagine is Windows struggling to handle all the input. Moving the curser usually sovles the issue.
